Minimalist-HTML
===============

This is the source code to my website http://www.floriandejonckheere.be. It is a purely black and white minimalist HTML 'framework' featuring a dead simple menu bar with social media links and single column layout. The navigation bar is loaded via PHP from an external file, in order to unify and simplify the website's structure.
